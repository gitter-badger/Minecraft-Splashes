This is a simple repo of all the current Splashes from Minecraft! Splashes from PE and Console.

## Instructions
Just open download the repo, open the Splashes.csv file and read all the splashes.

We recommend you open the .csv file in either Microsoft Office Excel or in Open Office or Libre Office.



This file has been copyed from the Program Files for Minecraft and then converted from a JSON to a CSV.


## Future Features
In the future I would like to add a Word file of the splashes and reach out to all of the PC splashes too.
